<h1>Strive</h1>
<h2>An analytics app connected to Strava</h2>
<hr>
<p>Strive uses the Strava API to calculate your performance on key areas when you record (a ride, run, swim, etc). Some of the aggregated data includes your average watts, elevation gained, and distance. This gives you the opportunity to compare yourself to top athletes, monitor progress toward a goal - as well as find segments near you that will help you reach your goal.</p>
